lua-resty-kafka
===============

Lua kafka client driver for the ngx_lua based on the cosocket API

Status
======

This library is still under early development and is still experimental.

Description
===========

This Lua library is a Kafka client driver for the ngx_lua nginx module:

http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpLuaModule

This Lua library takes advantage of ngx_lua's cosocket API, which ensures
100% nonblocking behavior.

Note that at least [ngx_lua 0.9.3](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module/tags) or [ngx_openresty 1.4.3.7](http://openresty.org/#Download) is required.


Synopsis
========

```lua
    lua_package_path "/path/to/lua-resty-kafka/lib/?.lua;;";
    resolver 8.8.8.8;
    server {
        location /test {
            content_by_lua '
                local cjson = require "cjson"
                local client = require "resty.kafka.client"
                local producer = require "resty.kafka.producer"

                local broker_list = {
                    { host = "127.0.0.1", port = 9092 },
                }

                local key = "key"
                local message = "halo world"

                -- usually we do not use this library directly
                local cli = client:new(broker_list)
                local brokers, partitions = cli:fetch_metadata("test")
                if not brokers then
                    ngx.say("fetch_metadata failed, err:", partitions)
                end
                ngx.say("brokers: ", cjson.encode(brokers), "; partitions: ", cjson.encode(partitions))


                -- sync producer_type
                local p = producer:new(broker_list)

                local offset, err = p:send("test", key, message)
                if not offset then
                    ngx.say("send err:", err)
                    return
                end
                ngx.say("send success, offset: ", offset)

                -- this is async producer_type and bp will be reused in the whole nginx worker
                local bp = producer:new(broker_list, { producer_type = "async" })

                local size, err = p:send("test", key, message)
                if not size then
                    ngx.say("send err:", err)
                    return
                end

                ngx.say("send success, size", size)
            ';
        }
    }
```


Modules
=======


resty.kafka.client
----------------------

To load this module, just do this

```lua
    local client = require "resty.kafka.client"
```

### Methods

#### new

`syntax: p = producer:new(broker_list, client_config)`

The `broker_list` is a list of broker, like the below

```json
[
    {
        "host": "127.0.0.1",
        "port": 9092
    }
]
```

An optional `client_config` table can be specified. The following options are as follows:

client config

* `socket_timeout`

    Specifies the network timeout threshold in milliseconds. *SHOULD* lagrer than the `request_timeout`.

* `keepalive_timeout`

    Specifies the maximal idle timeout (in milliseconds) for the keepalive connection.

* `keepalive_size`

    Specifies the maximal number of connections allowed in the connection pool for per Nginx worker.

* `refresh_interval`

    Specifies the time to auto refresh the metadata in milliseconds. Then metadata will not auto refresh if is nil.


#### fetch_metadata
`syntax: brokers, partitions = client:fetch_metadata(topic)`

In case of success, return the all brokers and partitions of the `topic`.
In case of errors, returns `nil` with a string describing the error.


#### refresh
`syntax: brokers, partitions = client:refresh()`

This will refresh the metadata of all topics which have been fetched by `fetch_metadata`.
In case of success, return all brokers and all partitions of all topics.
In case of errors, returns `nil` with a string describing the error.


resty.kafka.producer
----------------------

To load this module, just do this

```lua
    local producer = require "resty.kafka.producer"
```

### Methods

#### new

`syntax: p = producer:new(broker_list, producer_config)`

It's recommend to use async producer_type.

`broker_list` is the same as in `client`

An optional options table can be specified. The following options are as follows:

`socket_timeout`, `keepalive_timeout`, `keepalive_size`, `refresh_interval` are the same as in `client_config`

producer config, most like in <http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#producerconfigs>

* `producer_type`

    Specifies the `producer.type`. "async" or "sync"

* `request_timeout`

    Specifies the `request.timeout.ms`. Default `2000 ms`

* `required_acks`

    Specifies the `request.required.acks`, *SHOULD NOT* be zero. Default `1`.

* `max_retry`

    Specifies the `message.send.max.retries`. Default `3`.

* `retry_backoff`

    Specifies the `retry.backoff.ms`. Default `100`.

* `partitioner`

    Specifies the partitioner that choose partition from key and partition num.
    `syntax: partitioner = function (key, partition_num, correlation_id) end`,
    the correlation_id is an auto increment id in producer. Default partitioner is:


```lua
local function default_partitioner(key, num, correlation_id)
    local id = key and crc32(key) or correlation_id

    -- partition_id is continuous and start from 0
    return id % num
end
```

buffer config ( only work `producer_type` = "async" )

* `flush_size`

    Specifies the minimal buffer size(total byte size) to flush. Default 10240, 10KB.

* `flush_time`

    Specifies the time (in milliseconds) to flush. Default 1000ms.

* `max_size`

    Specifies the maximal buffer size to buffer. Default 10485760, 1MB.
    Be carefull, *SHOULD* be smaller than the `socket.request.max.bytes` config in kafka server.

* `error_handle`

    Specifies the error handle, handle data when buffer send to kafka error.
    `syntax: error_handle = function (topic, partition_id, message_queue, index, err) end`,
    the failed messages in the message_queue is like ```{ key1, msg1, key2, msg2 } ```,
    `key` in the message_queue is empty string `""` even if orign is `nil`.
    `index` is the message_queue length, should not use `#message_queue`.

Not support compression now.


#### send
`syntax: ok, err = p:send(topic, key, message)`

1. In sync model

    In case of success, returns the offset of the current broker and partition.
    In case of errors, returns `nil` with a string describing the error.

2. In async model

    The `message` will write to the buffer first.
    It will send to the kafka server when the buffer exceed the `flush_size`,
    or every `flush_time` flush the buffer.

    It case of success, returns the message size(byte) add to buffer (key length + message length).
    In case of errors, returns `nil` with a string describing the error (`buffer overflow` or `not found topic`).


#### flush

`syntax: num, err = bp:flush()`

It will force send the messages that buffered to kafka server.
Return the send success messages num.


Installation
============

You need to configure
the lua_package_path directive to add the path of your lua-resty-kafka source
tree to ngx_lua's LUA_PATH search path, as in

```nginx
    # nginx.conf
    http {
        lua_package_path "/path/to/lua-resty-kafka/lib/?.lua;;";
        ...
    }
```

Ensure that the system account running your Nginx ''worker'' proceses have
enough permission to read the `.lua` file.


TODO
====

1.  Fetch API
2.  Offset API
3.  Offset Commit/Fetch API
